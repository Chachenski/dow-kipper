# Capstone Proposal Collectors App: DOW KIPPER

## 1. Store Collectible Items(Ex. Baseball Cards) from Users and log their values akin to a stock ticker
> Utilize an Ebay api to collect real time data to accurately reflect the value of the user's collectible
> Implement a UI element to dynamically show the changing value of their collection
    > Highest Sold Price
    > Lowest Sold Price
    > Last Sold
    > Change the color of graph from green to red depending on an increase or decrease in value
    > Display the volume of trades for that collectible, demonstrates liquidity and volatily 

> Limit the scope of collectibles to Baseball Cards, and one other cateogry if time permits

## 2. Learning Goals
> TypeScript 
> Tailwind(Ian, Tim)
> Stretch Goal: AWS deployment 

## Stretch Goal:
